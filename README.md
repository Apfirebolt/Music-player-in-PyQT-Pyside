# Music Player in Python using PySide6/PyQt5 GUI

A Music player application in Python using PySide6 and other QT tools. I used to prefer Tkinter earlier but QT is my de facto choice of building desktop applications these
days. This would just be another experimental app based on one of the course project that I am currently doing.

## Getting Started

Create a new virtual environment as a best practice norm. Install python packages through pip using the bundled requirements
file. Install PySide6 and other related packages after activating the virtual environment.

## Background

As a software engineer, part of my work involves working on developing desktop based applications in my current organization. My area of expertise in developing web based applications.
I am pursueing this course on Udemy - https://www.udemy.com/course/python-gui-development-with-pyside6-qt-for-python to gain more knowledge in building quality
desktop applications using Python.

This course also included a Music player and Video player as part of the curriculum. I tried to create this with most of the code and image resources copied from this
repository but on top of it I also plan to extend it with features such as adding a playlist, maintaining it by adding/removing songs in the playlist.

## Features

- Audio files can be played by opening them through a file dialog inside the applications.
- Basic controls like play, pause, volume are provided.
- Plan to extend the application by including playlist in the future.
